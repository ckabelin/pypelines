# Feature Specification: Run everything that is possible with uv

**Feature Branch**: `001-run-everything-that`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Run everything that is possible with uv"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors (developer/CI), actions (run/help/test), data (test outputs, server logs), constraints (safe local commands only)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- Focus on WHAT the user wants (run all available `uv` functionality) and WHY (validate CLI, run tests, start server where safe).
- Avoid prescribing internal implementation details beyond the CLI surface.

### Section Requirements
- Mandatory sections completed below. Ambiguities are marked where decisions are required.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want the project-provided `uv` CLI to demonstrate and exercise all its supported commands (help, run, test) so I can verify the development experience, test suite behavior, and that running the ASGI app is possible in the environment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a developer environment with the project checked out, when they run `uv --help` or `uv -h`, then the CLI prints usage information including `run` and `test` subcommands.
2. Given a developer environment with dev dependencies installed, when they run `uv test`, then pytest runs and returns exit code 0 for a passing test suite (or non-zero with clear failure output).
3. Given a developer environment with uvicorn available and the app importable, when they run `uv run --host 127.0.0.1 --port 0 --reload` (port 0 => ephemeral), then uvicorn starts and binds (in CI this may be headless; prefer dry-run or `--help` in automation).

### Edge Cases
- If dev dependencies cannot be installed (network, resolver errors): report failure and skip `uv test` step.
- If the app cannot be imported (missing environment variables or optional AI extras required): `uv run` should fail with a clear message and non-zero exit code.
- `uv run` with `--reload` in a headless CI environment may spawn file watchers which are inappropriate; prefer `--reload` only in local dev.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The `uv` CLI MUST expose `run` and `test` subcommands and a top-level help message.
- **FR-002**: `uv test` MUST run pytest programmatically and return its exit code.
- **FR-003**: `uv run` MUST attempt to import `pypelines.main:app` or `create_app()` and return a clear error if not importable.
- **FR-004**: `uv run` SHOULD allow passing `--host`, `--port`, and `--reload` flags to uvicorn.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST avoid executing destructive or network-sensitive commands without explicit consent. `uv run` will bind locally by default.

*Ambiguities / Clarifications*
- **FR-006**: Should `uv run` automatically start in CI during spec validation? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: prefer NO — only validate help/import unless user explicitly asks to start server].

### Key Entities
- `uv` CLI: surface-level commands and flags.
- `pypelines.main` app: ASGI app or factory used by `uv run`.
- Test runner: pytest invocation via `uv test`.

## Review & Acceptance Checklist

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation language details beyond CLI surface.
- [x] Focused on user value: verify CLI and lightweight validation of run/test functionality.

### Requirement Completeness
- [x] All mandatory sections completed.
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] `uv run` behavior in CI (see FR-006).

## Execution Status

- [x] User description parsed
- [x] Key concepts extracted
- [x] Ambiguities marked
- [x] User scenarios defined
- [x] Requirements generated
- [x] Entities identified
- [ ] Review checklist passed (blocked by FR-006 clarification)

Prepared for follow-ups: once the user confirms whether `uv run` should be started during CI/remote validation, this spec can be finalized and used to drive an automated verification job.
